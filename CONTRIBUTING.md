### How to contribute?

You can give feedback, report bugs and request new features anytime by
opening an issue. Also, you can up-vote and comment on existing issues.

To make a pull request into the repo, such as bug fixes, documentation
or new features, follow these steps:

* If it's a new feature, open an issue for preliminary discussion with
  us, to ensure your contribution is a good fit and doesn't duplicate
  on-going work.
* Typically, you'll need to accept Microsoft Contributor Licence
  Agreement (CLA).
* Familiarize yourself with coding style and guidelines.
* Fork the repository, code your contribution, and create a pull
  request.
* Wait for an MMMLSpark team member to review and accept it.  Be patient
  as we iron out the process for a new project.

A good way to get started contributing is to look for issues with a "help
wanted" label.  These are issues that we do want to fix, but don't have
resources to work on currently.
